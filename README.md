# Sentiment and Context-Aware Hybrid DNN with Attention for Text Sentiment Classification

This project presents a deep learning model for classifying textual data into **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** sentiments. It uses a hybrid Deep Neural Network (DNN) architecture integrated with an attention mechanism to better capture contextual meaning from text.

## 📌 Description

The model is trained using labeled data and makes use of an embedding layer, Bidirectional LSTM, attention layer, and fully connected dense layers. It’s designed for applications like social media monitoring, product review analysis, and feedback categorization.
